  "title": "Motor Load Imbalance Detection",
  "description": "Detect if the load of an electric motor is balanced or not",
  "long_description": "This project allows you to develop an AI model capable of detecting imbalances in the motor load while the motor is operating. The model is suitable for real-time, low powered embedded applications in industrial machines (conveyers, pumps, compressors), automotive systems (Electrical Vehicle motors, actuators), etc.",
