    "long_description": "This project allows you to train a YOLO-based model to identify objects on a ground like toys, hedgehogs, balls, humans, and other obstacles in a gray scale TOF image. This model is suitable for a variety of applications including object and animal detection for autonomous lawn mowers and indoor and outdoor object detection for robot vacuum cleaners.",
