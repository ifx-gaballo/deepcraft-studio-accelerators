  "long_description": "This project allows you to build a human activity detector that can be used on any supported Infineon MCU (or other MCUs) with a BMI160 IMU or another IMU. You can use this project as a starting point to develop a production ready model intended for deployment in wristed wearables. The available model is capable of detecting the following human activities: running, standing, walking, sitting, jumping.",
