  "description": "This project uses a microphone to detect glass breaking sounds.",
  "long_description": "This machine learning project focuses on developing a glass break detection model that can accurately identify glass break events by analyzing audio signals. Such models play a critical role in modern security infrastructures, where they enhance situational awareness and enable rapid response. Glass break detection can be deployed home security, commercial and retail buildings and in vehicles.",
