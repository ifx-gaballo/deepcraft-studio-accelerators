    "description": "In this project, we build a regression model to estimate Li-Ion battery state",
    "long_description": "This project is an example for Li‑ion battery state estimation using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. We estimate battery State of Charge (SoC). It represents the amount of electrical charge currently stored in a battery relative to its maximum capacity, expressed on a 0–1 scale.",
