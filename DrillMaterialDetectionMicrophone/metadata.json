  "description": "Use a microphone to detect the material being drilled into using audio signature.",
  "long_description": "This project allows you to develop a model that is capable of classifying the material a power drill is drilling into based on the audio signature and is imagined to be incorporated into smart power tools. The current project only differentiates between wood, plastic, and air but is easily scalable to include more labels.",
